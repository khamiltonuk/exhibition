  - An exhibition in Berlin's Parochialkirche, mid-October to the end of November (opening

  - planned for Wednesday/Thursday 14/15 October)
    COVID19 - A pandemic has struck the whole of humanity, there is no one who is not affected
    in some way. A potentially deadly virus still produces consequences that are difficult to
    assess. The months-long shutdown forces cultural life to pause, to reorient, to reformulate -
    and threatens the existence of cultural workers. The question of survival arises on many
    levels. And the question of whether life needs to be rethought. In detail, in the various social
    bubbles, the large social organisms and in humanity thought globally.
